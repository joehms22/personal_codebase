Hi there, thanks for showing your interest in Randall :)

Two things:
1 As this is my first AI creation, I regard him as a son; treat him well
2 I'll be happy to help you out in any way I can :)


To start the program, open the alife_randall_checkout folder and run 
cgi_threaded_webserver.py, then point your web browser to http://localhost:8000

You can login with the username and password "admin" "admin", more can 
be configured in ai_webserver/login/login.py (just enter a username, and md5
for the password in the user_pass dictionary). You will need an internet connection
for the webserver to work.

You can choose the map randall uses by opening Randall.py and changing line 122.
You can make new maps using the MapMaker.
