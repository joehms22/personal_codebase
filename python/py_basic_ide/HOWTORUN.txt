You should allready have python and wxpython installed.

Try double clicking the Run.Command file, if this gives you an error, try Ctrl+Clicking it and chooseing open in iTerm.app. If this option does 
not appear, try running iTerm.app first, which is found in the bin directory of the project.

If this does not work, open the bin folder, and run iTerm.app (or your systems terminal found in Applications>Utilities>Terminal, then drag and drop the Run.Command file into the iTerm.app/Terminal and press return.
