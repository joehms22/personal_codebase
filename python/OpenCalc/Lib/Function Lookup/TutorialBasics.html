<h5>Starting Out</h5>
Welcome to <b>OpenCalc</b>! My name is <b>Joe Lewis</b>, and I have written the program along with a few others, and I have also written this document. I can be reached at <i>joehms22@gmail.com</i>. Why is this program free? Well it is because I needed it, and therefore built it, but a program is no fun if only you are using it, so I sent it into the world, and now <b>people like you can help, here is how</b>.
<ul>
<li>Program for us.</li>
<li>Do web design</li>
<li>Tell your friends to use OpenCalc</li>
<li>Teach someone else (because humans teaching are better than this)</li>
<li>Donate some money (We would like this <b>least</b>, we are not for profit)</li>
<li>Write some documentation like this, someone can help you format if you don't know how.</li>
<li>Write about us in your blog</li>
<li>Translate it to another language (Quite easy)</li>
<li>Anything we are forgetting.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Layout</h5>
Being new to OpenCalc, lots of the interface may seem confusing, the menubar is different, there are interesting tabs filled with gibberish, etc. In a short amount of time you will be flying through the program like a pro! But first you will sometimes see things like this:
<pre>
==<b>2*2</b>
4
</pre>
This shows an input (the top line, preceeded by ==) please <b>don't</b> type the two == signs, this is what the program shows you to differentiate between your input and it's output.
</a>

<h5>Basic Operations (x / + -)</h5>
Switch to the tab labeled <i>Pad</i> (It is on the far left), you can do this by pressing the tab, or by going to Pad > Switch To Pad. You will see two boxes and a button in the tab.

In the smaller box (the one at the bottom) type in <b>2+2</b>, then press submit.
