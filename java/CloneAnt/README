Thanks for taking interest in ConeAnt; a SimAnt clone.

The game can be run as either an applet or as a standalone jar.


If you use ConeAnt, please shoot me over an email (even
if it is short) as I  may have updated versions that I could send you 
and would love to hear how they are being used.

Thanks,
 Joseph Lewis <joehms22@gmail.com>
